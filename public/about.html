<h1>About Me</h1>

<h3>Lohit Jhajhria</h3>

<p>
  I 'm honest, driven and strong willed individual who is willing to take
  responsibilities and enjoy assimilating new knowledge. A dog lover who always
  try to help others and prefer to show who I'm in real. This is what I feel is
  my weakness as sometimes it is not likeable by people to be straight forward.
